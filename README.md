<h1 align="center">Bloqcoin [BLOQ, à¸¿]</h1>

Bloqcoin is a new kind of storage, incentivized by cryptoeconomics. The Bloqcoin software allows anyone to operate a node in the Bloqcoin blockchain networks. It is adapted from Bloqcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

**Website:** [bloqcoin.org](https://www.bloqcoin.org/)

## Usage

To start your journey with Bloqcoin, see the [installation guide](doc/README.md).

The JSON-RPC API provided by Bloqcoin is self-documenting and can be browsed with `bloqcoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `bloqcoin-cli help <command>`.

### Ports

Bloqcoin by default uses port `28333` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `28332` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | signet  | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   28333 |   38333 |   48333 |   18444 |
| RPC      |   28332 |   38332 |   48332 |   18332 |
